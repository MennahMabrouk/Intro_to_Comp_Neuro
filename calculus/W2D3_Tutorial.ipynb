        "Differentiation of a function $f(t)$ gives you the derivative of that function $\\frac{d(f(t))}{dt}$. A derivative captures how sensitive a function is to slight changes in the input for different ranges of inputs. Geometrically, the derivative of a function at a certain input is the slope of the function at that input. For example, as you drive, the distance traveled changes continuously with time. The derivative of the distance traveled with respect to time is the velocity of the vehicle at each point in time. The velocity tells you the rate of change of the distance traveled at different points in time. If you have slow velocity (a small derivative), the distance traveled doesn't change much for small changes in time. A high velocity (big derivative) means that the distance traveled changes a lot for small changes in time.\n",

For a signal going through changes as a function of time, the derivative will become zero when the signal changes its direction of change (e.g. from increasing to decreasing). That is, at local minimum or maximum values, the slope of the signal will be zero. This property is used in optimizing problems. But we can also use it to find peaks in a signal. \n",

        "In the **Top-Left** plot, we see how the neuron output rate increases as a function of excitatory input (e.g., the blue trace). However, as we increase inhibition, expectedly the neuron output decreases and the curve is shifted downwards. This constant shift in the curve suggests that the effect of inhibition is subtractive, and the amount of subtraction does not depend on the neuron output. \n",
